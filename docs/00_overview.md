# RIMS — Radiology Information Management System

This project implements an independent Radiology Information Management System (RIMS),
designed to later merge cleanly with an existing LIMS platform.

Primary goals:
- End-to-end radiology workflow
- Structured reporting via template builder
- Deterministic PDF report output
- Auditability and medico-legal safety
- Merge-ready architecture

Scope (MVP):
Patient → Service → Study → Report → Draft → Final → PDF
